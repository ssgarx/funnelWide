    <em>Uncertainity</em>
    <p>He met a person, who talks about her ex and their qualities, concluding the conversation with frustration about
        the
        outcome. <br>
        He thought about it, "It's the uncertainity, that makes our endeavours exiting, it is the reason that fuels our
        <b>why</b>,
        <br>
        Imagine knowing exactly how things ends up with a person, that would be so boring is'nt it? We know how it ends
        for a chicken in a animal farm." <br>
        He learned this in a hard way, but he likes what he learned, he intends to master this art of acceptance. <br>
        Uncertainity is life.
